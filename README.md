<h4>The Cardiovascular Disease Prediction project aims to predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on their medical records and history. 
By analyzing various factors, the project calculates the probability of cardiovascular disease developing in a patient. This predictive model is a valuable tool
for identifying individuals at higher risk and enabling early intervention.<h4>
